# ML_basics_and_Gradient_Descent
1st/3 assignment of the "Machine Learning (ML) - Patterns Recognition" course (Spring Semester 2023). Basics of ML and implementation of the Gradient Descent algorithm.

## files
1) Assignment 1.pdf contains the objectives of the exercise (Spring Semester 2023)
2) Matrix Cookbook.pdf containts useful math types for matrices, vectors and other calculation formulas.
   You can find it here: https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf
3) github_ML_basics_Gradient_Descent.ipynb contains the Python code implementing the objectives

## how to execute
You can run the code shells of the .ipynb file and see the logic and the results of the implementation.
